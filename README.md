  ## Installation

  If there is no node_module folder and/or pacakge-lock.json file in application directory. Users must open a new terminal window, travel to the application main directory and type npm install in the terminal. The needed packages should be installed after a short while. Next run mysql in order to create the database. Then seed the databases using the js file found in the seeds folder. A video guide will be provided below:

  ## Usage

  After installing all needed packages, then type node server.js to start the application. Once the application is running it is strongly reccomended to use an API client tool like Insomnia to test out functionality of application. Follow the video guides below for a breakdown. The root url to make calls will be: (http://localhost:3001/api). Video guides will further demonstrate how to customize url for different methods.
